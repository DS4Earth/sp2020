Lesson overview
===============

This week we will focus on making decisions and repeating tasks in Python.
Both of these concepts are part of the larger computing idea called *control flow*, which refers to how the execution of different parts of a computer program is determined.
We will learn how to alter the execution of our scripts are using (1) *loops*, which are used to repeat execution of parts of a program, and (2) *conditional statements*, which use basic logical tests to determine which parts of a program will be run.

1. `Definite loops <../../notebooks/L3/for-loops.ipynb>`_
2. `Conditional statements <../../notebooks/L3/conditional-statements.ipynb>`_
3. `Good coding practices - Writing readable code <../../notebooks/L3/gcp-3-pep8.ipynb>`_
4. :doc:`Exercise 3: for loops and conditional statements <exercise-3>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

    - Create a ``for`` loop and use it to repeat a section of code
    - Use ``if``, ``elif``, and ``else`` statements to make decisions in your programs
    - Explain how values can be compared using comparison operators
