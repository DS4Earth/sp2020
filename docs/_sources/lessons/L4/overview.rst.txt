Lesson overview
===============

In this lesson we will learn how to create and use *functions*, one of the most powerful concepts in programming.
We will also introduce you to the concept of a *module* (also known as a library in other programming languages), which you can think of as a toolbox for a specific purpose.
Each module contains specific functionalities (i.e., functions) that you can use for different tasks.
Thus functions and modules are closely related.

2. `Loading and using modules <../../notebooks/L4/modules.ipynb>`_
3. `Writing scripts the "right" way <../../notebooks/L4/writing-scripts.ipynb>`_
4. :doc:`Exercise 4: Classifying and converting temperatures <exercise-4>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

  - Explain how functions are used and their benefits
  - Create your own functions to calculate an output value based on an input value
  - Save functions to a script file for future use
