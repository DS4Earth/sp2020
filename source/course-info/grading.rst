Grading

General grading breakdown
-------------------------
Course grades will be given using the standard six-level grading scale from 0 to 5:

- 5 (Excellent)
- 4 (Very Good)
- 3 (Good)
- 2 (Satisfactory)
- 1 (Passable)
- 0 (Fail)

For the Geo-Python part of the course your grade will be based on weekly laboratory exercises, 7 in total.

.. note:: Deadlines for exercises are firm and given in the course schedule.
          Generally, exercises are due at the start of class the week following their assignment.
          If you anticipate you will not be able to submit the exercises in the given deadline, you should let us know as early as possible, latest one day in advance before the deadline.
          Late write-ups will be marked down 25% per day late, so please submit them on time.

.. note:: In case you are enrolled in the Automating GIS processes course (GEOG-329), your grade will be based on exercises (periods 1 and 2) and a final assignment (period 2).
