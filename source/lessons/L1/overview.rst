Week 1 overview
===============

To introduce you how we will work during the course using different tools including a
dedicated computing environment, which is based on the principles of `cloud
computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>`__. This first
tutorial will introduce you to the basic components of the course
environment, guide you through how they are used, and conclude with a
hands-on introduction to some key concepts and elements of programming
in Python. The main components of this first lesson are below.

1. :doc:`Overview of the course environment <course-environment-components>`
2. :doc:`Communicating and chatting with Slack <slack-usage>`
3. `Intro to Python tutorial <../../notebooks/L1/intro_to_python.ipynb>`_
4. `Intro to Numpy and Matplotlib <../../notebooks/L1/numpy_and_matplotlib.ipynb>`_

.. note::
