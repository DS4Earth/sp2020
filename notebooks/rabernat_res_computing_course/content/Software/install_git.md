## Installing Git


#### OS X:

If you've installed Xcode (or it's Command Line Tools), Git may already be installed.
To find out, open a terminal and type "which git". You should get the answer:

/usr/bin/git

If not, then go install Xcode and the command line tools using these instructions:

1. Install the Xcode application from the Mac App Store. Open the installed Xcode app, agree to the license, and let it install some "components"

2. Install the Xcode command-line tools. Open a terminal window (Applications > Utilities > Terminal). Type xcode-select --install and follow the dialogs that open
