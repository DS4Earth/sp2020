## Installing MATLAB

You can acquire a MATLAB license and instructions for installing the software by sending an email
from your LDEO or Columbia University email account to:
<a href="mailto:askit@ldeo.columbia.edu?body=I am a student at LDEO and would like to install the MATLAB software on my computer. Thank you. &subject=student request for MATLAB software">askit@ldeo.columbia.edu</a>.

MATLAB uses a license server on campus and thus may only run when your computer is on the university network,
or if you remotely connect using the LDEO VPN server.

## Sample Code


```Matlab
x = 1:10;
y = x.^2;
figure;
plot(x,y,'.-')
```

##   Getting help

Open the MATLAB help documentation, which can be accessed by the "Help" button on the MATLAB main window or you can
