## Installing Unix

#### OS X and Linux

OS X and Linux come with the unix routines we will be using, so you don't need to install anything.  Simply open up a terminal window
and you can start typing in unix commands.

On OS X, the terminal program is /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app (Applications > Utilities > Terminal)

#### Windows

Download and install Cygwin: <a href=" https://cygwin.com"  target="_blank">  https://cygwin.com</a>
