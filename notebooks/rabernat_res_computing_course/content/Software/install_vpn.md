A VPN is a virtual private network. If you are off-campus,
you can log on to the LDEO VPN and your computer's IP address
will make it look like your computer is physically located on campus. This
is useful for accessing online material that is only available
using the campus network.

Point your web browser to the LDEO VPN log in screen:

https://vpn.ldeo.columbia.edu

Log in with your LDEO ID and Password.

After you have successfully logged in, you will be able to download and
install the new "OpenVPN Connect" Client and download the
configuration file.  This will put the OpenVPN login tool up on the menu bar (on OS X)
so that you can easily log in to the VPN.

Some useful things you can do with the VPN:

* access journal papers while off campus
* access online content from the Columbia library
* use software that is licensed only for on-campus usage
