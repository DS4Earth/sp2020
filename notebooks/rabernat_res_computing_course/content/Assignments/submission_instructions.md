You should already have created a
[github repository]({filename}/software/install_git.md) for
[assignment 2]({filename}Assignment_2.md).
We would like you to use this repository for _all your future assignments_.

Here are the steps you should take to modify your repository.

1. Create a directory called `assignment_2` in the root directory of the existing repo.
1. Use the command `git mv` to move all of your assignment 2 files into this directory.
1. Commit your changes and push them to github.
1. For future assignments (e.g. assignment 3), create appropriately named
subdirectories for your work.
1. Submit your future assignments by committing and pushing to the same repo.
1. Optional: [rename your repository on github](https://help.github.com/articles/renaming-a-repository/) to
`research_computing_assignments`
