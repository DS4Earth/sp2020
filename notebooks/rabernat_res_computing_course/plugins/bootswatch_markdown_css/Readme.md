# Pelican Support for Python-Markdown Table Extension

When using a pelican theme based on bootstrap and bootswatch like [iliork](http://github.com/yuex/pelican-iliork), it may be a headache to make the css redecorations provided by bootstrap get applied to those html tags generated by python modules. For `<pre>` and `<code>` generated by pygments, you have to write your own css because bootstrap provides no code highlighting css. But for `<table>` generated by python-markdown's table extension, there are css decorations provided by bootstrap and bootswatch. You can write your own css for `<table>`, no problem, but at the loss of elegance and convenience when switching bootstrap theme.

So I write this extension for pelican to rewrite the html output of python-markdown's table extension from `<table>` to `<table class="table table-strip...">` to make bootstrap's css available.

A neater way is to modify the table extension of python-markdown to make it accept arguments such as `'class=table table-strip...'`. But that will cause trouble in distributing and getting merged by upstream and perhaps also contradict the KISS-style of python-markdown as a markdown parser.
