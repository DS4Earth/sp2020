# Pangeo AGU 2018 Tutorial

Welcome to the Pangeo Tutorial at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting.
This is a live session from which you can run Jupyter notebooks showing how to Xarray, Dask, Jupyter.
Pangeo is a community effort and big-data platform for the geosciences.
This collection of tutorials is intended to demonstrate some of the operations that can be performed using Pangeo.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.  There are overview notebooks about how to use dask, and a variety of scientific use cases.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask `Client` (these are already written for you).

To get started, double click on a notebook on the left, like `getting_started.ipynb`, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

## Learn More

Links are available within each notebook for additional documentation on that topic.
